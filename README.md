# Nuxt 2->3 Workshop Exercises

This repo contains the boilerplate and solutions to the exercises in the Nuxt 2->3 workshop.

The exercise prompts that compliment this code can be [found in this notion doc](https://vueschool.notion.site/Nuxt-2-3-Exercises-0b8dc3ba81c548febed5ccfdb0a83a7d).

The main branch contains the code as it will be at the start of the workshop. It is not intended to be fully functional but a starting point.

During the workshop, you can checkout the starting point for each exercise (ie. `2.1-start`) and then see the solution on it's ending branch (ie `2.1-end`).
